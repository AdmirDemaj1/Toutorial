2. Component Design:

Compound components pattern
Higher-order components vs. custom hooks
Container/Presenter pattern
Design system implementation
Component composition over inheritance

3. State Management:

Global vs. local state separation
State normalization techniques
Caching strategies
Server state vs. client state
Real-time data synchronization

4. Performance Optimization:

- Component-Based Architecture:

Organizes code by UI component type
Components are highly reusable across different features
Easier to maintain consistent UI/UX
Better for design system implementation
Simpler to understand for new developers
Works well for smaller applications


- Feature-Based Architecture:

Organizes code by business domain/feature
Better encapsulation of feature-specific logic
Clearer boundaries between different parts of the application
Easier to manage complex business logic
Better for large applications with multiple teams
Makes it easier to implement feature flags

# Micro-frontend architecture for large applications

https://medium.com/appfoster/a-comprehensive-guide-to-micro-frontend-architecture-cc0e31e0c053

- Communication in micro frontends:

You can use Webpack Module Federation which:
Module Federation is an advanced feature in Webpack (and soon Rspack) that provides a way for a JavaScript application to dynamically load code from another application. This feature allows for efficient code sharing and dependency management. In this article, we will explore the architecture, prerequisites, and underlying implementation of Module Federation.

- Module Federation (Runtime Sharing):
https://scriptedalchemy.medium.com/understanding-webpack-module-federation-a-deep-dive-efe5c55bf366

- Sometimes you also want to share the state when reusing the componnets in Micro Frontend Architecture and for that you can use Recoiljs(https://recoiljs.org/) or Jotai(https://jotai.org/) and beside exposing only the componnet in the federation() we also expose the store. By the way you can also share complex functionality using Module Federation.

- Storybook (Package Sharing)

- Build Time vs Package sharing system


Question:
Cool I understand now module federation and how it works but when should I use it and when should I not use it? I have also seen examples of using drawers so one app can call the other app into that drawer and use it also I have seen that storybook has been used to share components. But I dont understand when one or another should be used. Explain this to me.

Answer:
Let me give you a concrete decision framework:
Use Module Federation when:

You have distinct features that need independent deployment
Different teams need to work autonomously
You want to load features on demand

Use Drawer Patterns/ IFrame when:

Users need quick access to related features
The context of the main application needs to be preserved
You want to show supplementary information temporarily

Use Storybook when:

You need to maintain design consistency
You want to share basic UI components between applications
You need a development environment for building and testing components


Question : 
What are the downsides of microfrontend architecture and what I should consider before using it?

Answer: 
Let me break down the key downsides and considerations of micro-frontend architecture:

1. Increased Complexity
```javascript
// Instead of one simple app
import { Component } from './components';

// You now manage multiple apps, bundlers, and dependencies
const RemoteComponent = React.lazy(() => import("app2/Component"));
const AnotherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("app3/Component"));
```

2. Bundle Size and Performance Issues
- Each micro-frontend might load its own copy of dependencies
- Multiple HTTP requests for different micro-frontends
- Potential duplicate code if not managed properly

3. Versioning and Dependency Conflicts
```javascript
// Team A uses React 17
// webpack.config.js for Team A
shared: {
  react: { requiredVersion: "^17.0.0" }
}

// Team B uses React 18
// webpack.config.js for Team B
shared: {
  react: { requiredVersion: "^18.0.0" }
}
// This can lead to conflicts!
```

4. Development and Testing Complexity
- Need to test each micro-frontend independently
- Need to test integrations between micro-frontends
- More complex local development setup
- More complex CI/CD pipelines

5. Consistency Challenges
- Different teams might use different:
  - Coding standards
  - UI libraries
  - State management solutions
  - Testing approaches

Consider micro-frontends when:
- You have a large application that's becoming unmanageable
- Multiple teams need to work independently
- Different parts of your application need different update cycles
- You need to gradually migrate a legacy application

Avoid micro-frontends when:
- Your application is small or medium-sized
- You have a single team
- Your application doesn't require independent deployments
- You need tight integration between all parts of your app

Key Questions to Ask Before Adopting:
1. Is your team large enough to justify the overhead?
2. Can you handle the additional operational complexity?
3. Do you have the infrastructure to support multiple deployments?
4. Is your application truly large enough to benefit from this approach?
5. Can you ensure consistent user experience across micro-frontends?

Example of Overhead:

```javascript
// Traditional monolithic app setup
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Header />
    <MainContent />
    <Footer />
  </div>
);

// Micro-frontend setup
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const Header = React.lazy(() => import("header/Header"));
const MainContent = React.lazy(() => import("content/Main"));
const Footer = React.lazy(() => import("footer/Footer"));

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading header...</div>}>
      <Header />
    </Suspense>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading content...</div>}>
      <MainContent />
    </Suspense>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading footer...</div>}>
      <Footer />
    </Suspense>
  </div>
);

// Plus additional setup for:
// - Module federation configuration
// - Build pipelines
// - Testing infrastructure
// - Deployment strategies
// - Monitoring and error tracking
// - Cross-team coordination
```

Infrastructure Considerations:
1. Need separate build and deployment pipelines
2. More complex monitoring setup
3. More complex error tracking
4. More resources for hosting multiple applications
5. More complex local development environment

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific examples of these challenges?

# Atomic design methodology

# Clean architecture principles in frontend

- `Separation of Concerns`: Each component in your application has a clear responsibility. This decoupling makes code easier to reason about, modify, and reuse.

- `Dependency Inversion Principle`: High-level modules shouldnâ€™t depend on low-level details. Instead, core business logic depends on abstractions (e.g., interfaces), making it possible to swap out concrete implementations without breaking things.


# Monorepo vs. multi-repo strategies

Component Design:

Compound components pattern
Higher-order components vs. custom hooks
Container/Presenter pattern
Design system implementation
Component composition over inheritance


// useMemo - Memoizes a computed value
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

// useCallback - Memoizes a function definition
const memoizedFunction = useCallback(() => doSomething(a, b), [a, b]);

The main difference is that:

useMemo caches the `result` of a computation
useCallback caches the `function` itself

// useMemo returns the `computed value`
const value = useMemo(() => x + y, [x, y]);
console.log(value); // Logs the sum of x and y

// useCallback returns the `function itself`
const handler = useCallback(() => x + y, [x, y]);
console.log(handler()); // Need to call the function to get the result


useMemo is best for:
// Expensive calculations
// Referential equality for objects

useCallback is best for:
// Event handlers
// Callbacks used in useEffect dependencies
