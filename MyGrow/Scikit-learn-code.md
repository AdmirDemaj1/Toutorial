## Builidng First Application using Scikit-learn

- Example 1: Training and Prediction Using Linear Regression (Linear Regression is used for regression problems), the code is in PredictingHousingPricesRegression.py. Here we want to see given some area data to predict the value of the house. So this falls under the regression problems.

- Example 2: Using Logistic Regression (This algorithm is used for Classification problems), the code is in PredictingHousingPricesClassification.py. Here we want to predict if a given house has the price below or up the mdeian_house_values. So we can get a number from 0 to 1 which relates to classification problem.

## Building Classification Models

- In the given code we are predicting if a passanger would die or not in Titanic based on the model using Logical Regression.
We are also predicting the accuracy, precision and recall.

- Beside this isnide the MultipleClassificationModels_Titanic you have a reusable function to try and run different ML models.
