# Gen Ai Architectures and models:
1. RNN (Recurent neural networks) -> It can be used for NLP, Language translation, Speech recognition, Image captioning
2. Transformers -> GPT, text generation
3. GANs (Generative adversarial networks) -> Image and Video generation
4. VAEs (Variational autoencoders) -> Art and creative design
5. Diffusion models -> Image generation

`Fine-tuning` is adjusting a pretrained model to improve performance 
for a specific task or dataset.
