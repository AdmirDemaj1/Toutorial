⛔ API GATEWAYS AND EDGE SERVICES ⛔

# API Gateways, what is an API Gateway?

    -  The API Gateway acts as a gatekeeper orchestrating the flow of requests and responses between clients and back-end services

    - They handle `API routing` from the client to the proper API Provider or microservice.

    - They distribute traffic across multiple instances of a microservice aslo called as `Load balancing ` ensuring even load distribution and high availability.

    - They manage user Authentication and Authorization (OAuth, LDAP or custom authentication methods) and access control policies for authorization.

    - Rate limiting/ throttling (we can set a rate limit of 5 requests for each minute)

    - API Gateways allow you to modify the request or the response data as it passes through the gateway so you can do error handling.

    - It can collect and combine responses from multiple microservices in cases when a request depents on multiple back-end microservices

    - Caching

    - It provides a single entry point for multiple microservices knowing that microservices can grow and become complex. It also manages the routing between tehse microservices

# Node.js Deployment

1. Development Environment
2. QA / Stage / Test environment
3. Production environment

# Express Gateway

Link: https://www.express-gateway.io/getting-started/

# Express Gateway Security
    - TLS/SSL: It ensures encryptic connections between clients and the API gateway and the associated back-end microservices.
    - Helmet.js: Setting several HTTP headers making it more difficult for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities.
    It can secure by:
    1. XSS protection (Cross-site scripting)
    2. HTTPS enforcment (reducing the risks of man-in-the-middle attacks)
    3. Clickjacking prevention (ensuring that web pages cannot be embedded within an iframe protecting against user interface manipulation.)
    4. MIME type sniffing protection
    5. Referrer policy control
    6. DNS prefetching control

# Using Express Gateway to Proxy and Manage APIs with OAuth
    - OAuth 2 is an open standard and auth protocol that provides a secure framework for granting third-party apps limited access to user-protected services without exposing user credentials.
     
    - When a client application seeks access to protected resources, the API gateway can act as an intermediary to handle the authorization process, specifically in the context of OAuth, which is a widely used protocol for authorization.

# Express Gateway Pipelines
    - It helps the developers to structure and manage the flow of HTTP requests through a series of defined stages or middleware.
    - A pipeline represents a sequence of processing steps that your request goes through before reaching its final destination.
    - Each step in the pipeline is known as a policy and it performs a specific function such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, custom business logic...
    - Gateway.config.yaml: serves as the central configuration file that defines the entire setup of the API gateway including the configuration for pipelines.

# Routing and Load Balancing

## Designing Effective Routing Strategies:
1. Path-based routing
2. Header based routing (Routes are based on HTTP header values)
3. Query-based Routing (Routes are based on query parameters in URL)

## Various load balancing algorithms that determine how requests are distributed:
1. Round robin
2. least connections
3. weighted round robin


# Scaling Techniques

- The primary goal of load balancing is to optimize resource utilization, prevent server overload, ensure high availability, and enhance the overall performance and reliability of the system.

- Whith Node, two common load balancers are often used in front of Express Gateway, which include NGINX and HA proxy.

- HORIZONTAL SCAILING
It is critical to consider shared state issues when we deal with Horizontal Scailing, to be mindful of this you should insure that shared resources like databases or caches can handle the increased number of connections and maintain data consistency across instances
 A newer technique thats become common is the use of stateless arch. where each request contains all information required to properl process.

 - VERTICAL SCAILING
 It can be used to handle increased resource demand for individual instances, while HS provides additional capacity.

 - Load balancing algorithms
 1. Random: randomly select a server to handle each request, it is simple and effective in scenarios where all servers have similar capabilities.
 2. Round Robin: distributes client requests evenly across all servers.
 3. Least Connection: Routes new requests to the server with fewest current connections. This algorithm is useful when applications workloads are unevenly distributed across the servers.
 4. IP Hashing: Directs requests from the same IP address to the same server ensuring session persistence.
 5. Least Time: Routes requests to the server with the lowest average response time. This algorithm is useful when the response time is critical.
 6. Least Bandwidth: Routes requests to the server with the lowest bandwidth usage.


 # Improve performance with clustering
 When dealing with cluster model (multi-threading) there are a few metrics that are useful.
 1. Response time: which measures the time taken to respond to requests.
 2. Throughput: which evaluates the number of requests processed per second.
 3. Latency: assesses the time taken for a request to be acknowledged.

 Autocannon is a open source tool that is useful for testing the performance of HTTP-based applications suach as Node.js


 # How NGINX works as Load Balancer
 ![alt text](image-1.png)
- NGINX can be putted in front of a pool of servers where it would work as a load balancer for direct back-end microservices or in front of Express Gateways.

- NGINX distributes incoming requests among the defined servers providing a scalable and fault-tolerant solution.

- To make it work you have to configure nginx.conf config file that contains the specification for how load balancing is to occur by defining both our server pools as well as our load balancing algorithm.

 # Authentication and Authorization

 ## Strategies and technicues/methods for authentication and authorization:

 1. Session-based authentication: username and password matched againts a stored database record.
 ![alt text](image-2.png)
 2. Token-based: only a token like JWT is sent for communication
 3. Password-less authentication: users only need an associated email address or phone number for creation of a magic link or one-time password for each login attempt.
 ![alt text](image-3.png)
 4. Protecting routes with role-based access control (RBAC)

 - For authentication protocols we have a few options:
 1. OAuth/OAuth 2.0: used with third-party authorization like social media logins.
 2. OpenID Connect: built on top of OAuth which focuses on authentication.
 3. SAML(Security Assertion Markup Language): enables single sign-on across multiple services. 

 ## Authorization
 1. Access control: we would have a few options such as role-based access control, attribute-based access control, mandatory access controls
 2. Authorization mechanisms

 - For authentication, Express Gateway offers a few benefits such as middleware that can be useful for authentication. Express API Gateway can leverage middleware functions to handle this authentication.
 🖊️Commonly used middlewares for authentication: Password.js , token-based autentication (JSON Web Tokens), single sign-on.

 - ⚠️ For systems implementing single sign-on the gateway can act as a central authentication point by validating user's credentials once and issues tokens for subsequent requests to microservices. This reduces the need for repetitive authentication checks.

 - Once the users or our systems are authenticated then the authorization policies and approaches can be utilized. Similar to Authentication Express Gateway offers many benefits to implementing authorization.


 ## AuthN/Z Techiques
 1. OAuth 2.0
 2. Openid Connect: Express Gateway acts as an OpenID Connect provider enabling features like single sign-on and identity federation.
 3. JWT tokens: for stateless authentication
 4. API key authentications: validation keys from requests
 5. Basic authentication

 ## AuthN/Z Best Practices
 1. Use Express Gateway as a centralized point for authentication to avoid duplicating authentication logic across microservices.
 2. Token validation like signature, expiration and issuer can be used to enhance security if using JWT.
 3. Implement rate limiting and throttling to protect against brute force attacks and other malicious activities.(Express gateway has them built in)
 4. Secure communication: we can use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and employ secure channels.
 5. Consider integrating multi-factor authentication expecially in scenarios where higher assurance is needed.
 6. API key rotation.
 7. Implement Role-based access control to manage access control efficiently. Express Gateways allows you to define roles. 😄


# Rate Limiting and Quotas

## What is Rate Limiting and Quotas
- Rate limiting and quotas ensure stable and reliable API performance by preventing sudden spikes in traffic that could overwhelm the system.
- They act as a protective barrier against abuse and security attacks by restricting the volume of requests a client can make within a specific timeframe. This prevents malicious attackers from overloading the system with excessive traffic safeguarding against distributed denial of service.
- Rate limiting and quotas contribute in overall scalability and availability of the system by preventing resource exhaustion. 

## Types of attacks rate limiting and quotas handle

1️⃣ Rate limitng
- DDoS attacks: makes it difficult for attackers to overwhelm the server with a high volume of requests as each client is limited to a certain number of requests per second.
- Brute force attacks: an attacker tries to gain unauthorized access by repeatedly attempting different combinations of usernames and passwords. 
- Protecting API resources
- Resource exhaustion attacks: an attacker tries to consume all available resources leading to service unavailability.

2️⃣ Quotas
- Prevent abuse and unauthorized access.
- Single client monopolizing resources.

## Rate Limitng Concepts, Techniques

1. Sliding window algorithm : controls the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specific timeframe.
2. Token bucket algorithm : we allocate tokens at a fixed rate and requests can only be made if there are vailable tokens.
3. Leaky bucket algorithm : we allow a fixed number of requests per unit of time.
4. Burst vs sustained limits : we distinguish between the maximum number of requests allowed in a short burst and the sustained rate over a longer period.
5. Soft vs hard limits.

## Rate Limiting Globally vs Specific Routes

- In Node we have quite a bit of flexibility in applying rate limiting. For Express web apps we can apply across all routes different rate-limiting algorithms. Lets say different rate limit algorithms/techniques for each route.
We can also configure it using Express Gateway by configuring it in our gateway.config.yml.
- But first make sure and determine which approach works best with your requirements.
- When applied to specific routes you have fine-grained controls and are able to adapt rate limits based on the nature of the data or functionality exposed by the route also gain optimized resource utilization. 
- Global rate limiting simplifies the configuration providing uniform protection and a bit easier maintainance. But there is a trade off, we do lose a bit of granual control if it needed.



# Caching in Edge Services

## Caching Strategies

1. Page Caching: we can cache the entire HTML page to serve them quickly without regenerating the content for each request.
2. Object Caching: we can cache specific objects or data structures such as database query results or API responses.
3. CDN Caching (Content Delivery Networks): suach as images, stylesheets, and scripts.
4. Fragments Caching : partial page updates.
5. In-Memory Caching
6. Distributed Caching

## Caching Expiration

Cache Expiration is cruicial to ensure that cache data remains up to date. Different caching systems employ various expiration mechanisms.

1. Time-based Expiration
2. Event-based Expiration
3. Lazy Loading

## Optimization

Optimizing caching involves maximizing the efficiency and performance benefits of caching strategies.
1. Cache Headers
2. Cache Busting
3. Compressed Caching
4. Selective Caching
5. Regular Monitoring
6. CDN Optimization




# ⛔ Node.js Microservices: Communication Patterns ⛔

## Lection 1 - Intro to Communication Patterns

### Sync vs Async Communication

- Synchronous Communication waits for response before moving on.

- Async Communication is like leaving a voice mail, one server sends a message and then moves on.

🗒️Key takeaways: Synchronous communication is useful for immediate, real-time interactions where quick responses are necessary.
Asynchronous communication is ideal for processes that can be decoupled and don't require immediate feedback.

### Overview of communication patterns

1. Event-Driven Communication (with REST API)
2. Webhooks - they are simple and powerfull for real-time data synchronization across services.
3. Massaging-based Communication - RabbitMQ and the Publish-Subscribe pattern play a crucial role
4. Remote Procedure Call - gRPC 
5. Real-time Communication using WebSockets

## Lection 2 - RESTful Services and Event-driven Communication in Microservices

### RESTful Services and Event-driven Architecture

- REST is built on top of request/response cycle where a client makes the request and the server provides the response. The server might itself make further calls to other services or APOs to create a full response.
- Rest is stateless which means the server does not have to keep track of the client. Each service can process the request in isolation.
- Given that the same request can generate the same response we can cache the response for static data.

📓 You can use eventEmmiters in nodejs in RESTapi-s to call other services. This pattern of using event emitters is a fundamental shift from a traditional response-only approach to an active event generation model. Through emitting events, services communicate and trigger subsequent actions in an asynchronous and loosely coupled manner.

REST is: 
1. Build on top of Client/Server
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Resource Driven


### Building Scalable RESTful Services

- RESTful services, by their nature, are very scalable. Their stateless protocol and ability to handle requests indepedently make them ideal for building systems that can grow and adapt with ease.

- Stateful vs Stateless Architecture

Stateful: the server retains information or state about each client across requests. This can lead to complexity and scalability challanges, as the server needs to manage and synchronize the state across multiple sessions.

Stateless: each request from the client contains all the information the server needs to process it.
This leads to a much simplier and scalable model.

- But why is the statelessness so beneficial for microservices?
▶️ It allows each service to operate independently without relying on shared state or context.
This independence is key for scailing, as services can be distributed across multiple servers or even geographic locations.

- Strategies to Help with Scalability as our traffic increases.
1. Caching
2. State offloading (to store the state about the request in a data storage so It can be distributed to all servers/services)
3. Session management


### Optimising RESTful API Performance

1. Pagination ➡️ it is key to managing and presenting large datasets. You might be trying to fetch thousands of records in a single API call, it is going to be pain in the ass. Pagination solves this by dividing the data into smaller, more manageable pages (like 10 items at a time). Pagination is a necessity for scalable , user-friendly API design.

2. Compression ➡️ data compression, particularly techniques like gzip play a pivotal role in minimizing the size of the data being transferred over the network. This can reduce the amound of bandwidth used,  by lowering the size of data transferred over the network.

3. Caching ➡️ for sure you can create your own function to handle the caching for a single service but when dealing with microservices it would be better to have a shared caching logic for all the services instead of each instance maintining its own cache . In this scenario you can use deistributed caching systems like Redis or Mcache. These systems allow multiple instances to share a common cache, ensuring consistency and reducing redudant data storage. While working with caching you should also consider: ⚠️ Cache invalidation, Read-through/write-through, session management, Cache warm-up, cosistent hasing, monitoring and analytics, fallback/failures strategies . These are very importants and useful technicues.
